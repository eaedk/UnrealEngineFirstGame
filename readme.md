# About Me
This is my first game. I'm starting to learn game development with Unreal Engine 5.
I like games a lot and for a long time I have been thinking of getting into this field, but I fell into the world of AI which took me many hours of learning and one thing leading to another I started my career in this field. Then, I devoted all my attention to improving my level and acquiring more skills in Artificial Intelligence. However, during Ester 2022, I finally made the leap into game development and I really hope to stay focused in order to reach a good level in this field.
